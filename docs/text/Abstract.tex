With the rise of artificial neural networks driven by improved computational resources, optimizing models for specific tasks has become crucial. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in image classification, proving valuable in applications such as autonomous driving and diagnostics. In this study, we conducted a systematic grid search to optimize digit classification on the MNIST dataset. We varied key hyperparameters, including the number of convolutional layers, kernel sizes, dropout rates, pooling, padding and activation functions, to assess their impact on performance. Our best CNN model achieved an accuracy of 98\%, significantly surpassing the 92\% accuracy of the baseline Logistic Regression model. These findings highlight the critical role of hyperparameter optimization in improving CNN performance, underscoring the importance of tailored model design for specific tasks. The significant improvement over traditional methods, such as Logistic Regression, demonstrates the potential of CNNs in achieving high accuracy for complex classification tasks.
