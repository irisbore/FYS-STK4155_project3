In this study, we compared the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks and Logistic Regression for digit classification on the MNIST dataset. Through grid search and optimization of hyperparameters, we demonstrated the superior performance of CNNs, achieving an accuracy of 99\% compared to 92\% for Logistic Regression. These findings illustrate the importance of nonlinear feature extraction in image classification tasks. Important insights include the minimal impact of padding and pooling configurations on MNIST, as well as the limited influence of dropout rates and activation functions under the chosen experimental conditions. The results clearly show the trade-off between computational efficiency and model complexity, with CNNs being essential for applications requiring near-perfect accuracy. While CNNs significantly outpreform Logistic Regression, their greater computational cost and reduced interpretability pose challenges. Future work could explore advanced hyperparameter tuning methods, such as Bayesian optimization, and assess the transferability of these findings to other datasets.
