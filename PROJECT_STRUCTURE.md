# The basic structure of your project

Here follows a set up on how to structure your report and analyze the data you have opted for.
## Part a)

The first part deals with structuring and reading the data, much along the same lines as done in projects 1 and 2. Explain how the data are produced and place them in a proper context.
## Part b)

You need to include at least two central algorithms, or as an alternative explore methods from decisions tree to bagging, random forests and boosting. Explain the basics of the methods you have chosen to work with. This would be your theory part.
## Part c)

Then describe your algorithm and its implementation and tests you have performed.
## Part d)

Then presents your results and findings, link with existing literature and more.
## Part e)
Finally, here you should present a critical assessment of the methods you have studied and link your results with the existing literature.
