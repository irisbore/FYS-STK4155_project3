With the rise of artificial neural networks enabled by improved computational resources, optimizing models for specific tasks has become crucial. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in image classification, proving valuable in applications such as autonomous driving and diagnostics. In this study, we perform a grid search across the number of nodes, layers, and activation functions to optimize digit classification on the MNIST dataset. We highlight the impact of different pooling layer implementations on performance and compare CNN results to logistic regression models implemented with PyTorch. By testing various learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs, the logistic regression model achieves an accuracy of 92\%, significantly lower than the 98\% accuracy of the CNN.
