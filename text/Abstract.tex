In a time where artificial neural networks are becoming useful in industry due to increased computational resources, it is essential to optimize the models for specific tasks. Convolutional neural networks are solving the specific task of image classification, which is beneficial in, for example, autonomous driving and diagnostics. We are doing a grid search of different number of nodes, number of layers and activation functions, to see what gives best accuracy for the classification of the 10 digits in the MNIST dataset. We emphasize how different implementations of pooling layers affect the results. Additionaly we compare the convolutional neural network with logistic regression created with Pytorch. By testing different values for learning rates, batch size and epochs we are able to achieve an accuracy of 92\% which is far below the accuracy of the convolutional neural network of 98\%.
